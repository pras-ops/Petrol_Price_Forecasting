# Petrol Price Forecasting using TensorFlow and Auto Keras

Petrol Prices are going up continuously these days, and it has become very hard to predict what will be the price range in the next few months or even days. This project aims to forecast the different petrol prices for the upcoming dates using various machine learning techniques and Auto Keras, an AutoML library.

## Timeline of the Project

-   Data Analysis
-   Model Building and predictions using ML techniques
-   Model Building and prediction using Auto Keras (AutoML)

## Data Analysis and Preprocessing

Data Analysis and preprocessing steps are performed on the dataset, including handling missing values, renaming columns, and visualization.

## LSTM Model

The LSTM model is built and trained using the training data.

## ARIMA Model

An ARIMA model is created and trained using the training data.

## Auto Keras

Auto Keras, an AutoML system based on Keras, is used to build a structured data regressor model. The model is trained and evaluated, and predictions are made using the test data. The best performing model is exported and summarized. The mean squared error is calculated for the predictions.

## Report

The findings of the project include:

-   LSTM Model: The LSTM model is trained on the petrol price dataset and used for forecasting future prices. The model shows a certain level of accuracy in predicting petrol prices based on historical data.
    
-   ARIMA Model: The ARIMA model is also trained on the petrol price dataset and used for forecasting future prices. The model provides another approach to predict petrol prices based on time series analysis.
    
-   Auto Keras: Auto Keras, an AutoML library, is utilized to automatically search for the best model architecture and hyperparameters for petrol price forecasting. The best performing model is selected and evaluated based on the mean squared error metric.
    

Overall, the project demonstrates different approaches to petrol price forecasting using machine learning techniques and AutoML, providing insights into the potential accuracy and performance of each model.
